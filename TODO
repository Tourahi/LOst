Tools Update:
    [x] Make the input class so it can accespt mutiple binds at a time
    [x] Instead of using lua math module use love.math

        - It considers moon classes "Unknown" objects
    [x] Update the Colors module --> Tint
    [] Bebop :

    [] Dashboard :
        [x] boost bar

    [] Refactor Bebop class and BebopFactory
    [] Basics of gameplay
        - ammo
        - boost [x]
        - HP
        - skill points
    [x] Drawing order
        - depth
    [x] Refactoring the bebops factory.

Bugs:
    [x] Projectile sometimes hit the player #1
        * Fixed : Added collision classes. (Yep i did not Read the docs :).)
    [x] In BebopFactory projectileHeading is sometimes nil #2
        * Fixed : if nil set it to vec2d.zero
    [x] Input Realease is not working && pressed return more than once in one frame #3
        * Fixed : Binds have to be in the load function.
    [x] Leak!!!
        * Fixed : collectables are not destroyed.

        

ideas:
    * Bebop factory should only provide a function that will
        load the required bebop by name.
        --> this means seperating the bebops into a seperate folder
